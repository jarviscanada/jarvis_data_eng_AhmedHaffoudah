# Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent
This project is under development. Since this project follows the GitFlow, the final work will be merged to the main branch after Team Code Team.
# Introduction
The Linux Cluster Monitoring agent is a tool that allows users to monitor nodes connected in a Linux cluster by tracking resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory) in real-time. The collected data is stored in a RDBMS and can be used to generate reports for resource planning. Users can get answer to business questions using the collected data by writing SQL queries.
